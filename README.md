## Customization

### Add New Users

To add new users to the user list, update the HTML structure in the `index.html` file. Each user should be added as a list item with the following structure:

```html
<li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
    <div class="user-info">
        <img src="https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/1.jpg" alt="User Avatar" class="rounded-circle mr-2">
        John Doe
    </div>
    <span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill">Admin</span>
</li>
```

### Modify Charts

The charts are created using Chart.js. You can find the chart configuration in the `script.js` file. To modify the charts, update the data and options within the respective chart initialization code:

```javascript
var salesChart = new Chart(document.getElementById('salesChart'), {
    type: 'line',
    data: {
        // Your data here
    },
    options: {
        // Your options here
    }
});
```
